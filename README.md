Hangman : 
Hangman is a word-guessing game that involves forming a word by correctly guessing letters six at a time. The game is played by drawing a hangman on a piece of paper or using an ASCII art representation of a hangman. The hangman starts with a complete body, and parts of the body are removed for each incorrect guess. They lose if the player runs out of guesses before correctly guessing the word. They win if the player correctly guesses the word before running out of guesses.
